Version 2.0
===========

2010-01-06  Markus Riester  <markus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de>

2.0.0:

New Features: 
    -- support for monoecious plants
	-- support for clonal populations
	-- output genotypes in PARENTE format
	-- output allele frequency S.E. in locisummary
	-- output parent pair posterior probabilities
	-- exact ML algorithm (Robert Cowell, --saexactmax option) 
	-- if --N and --Nmax is omitted, a complete sampling is assumed

Minor Changes:
    -- dcmt from 0.5 to 0.6.1
	-- uthash to 1.9.3
	-- included Romanov and Futurama data in examples
	-- fixed crash in HWE test (thanks James!)
	-- fix for new autoconf (new m4/openmp.m4)
	-- fix for underflow problems with large numbers of loci (thanks Daniel!)
	
Version 1.2
===========

2009-24-06  Markus Riester  <markus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de>

1.2.0:

New Features:
	--mismatchout option: 
	   Mother-offspring mismatches and mismatches observed
	   during MCMC are listed in this output file

Important Performance enhancements:

	* FRANz is now significantly faster on huge datasets (>10000) 
	* less memory consumption (especially --fullsibtest).
	* minor optimizations

Minor Bugfixes
	
Minor improvements:
	--verbose flag now more useful


2009-29-06  Markus Riester  <markus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de>

1.2.1:

Minor improvements:

	* std. deviation in summary.txt
	* warning if data contains alleles coded as '0' (some programs code
	  missing values with a zero)

Bugfixes:

	* crash with --selfing 
	* leading 0 in infile caused problems			
	
1.2.2:

2009-08-07  Markus Riester  <markus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de>

Major Improvements:

	* More efficient MCMC sampling. Instead of simple Metropolis
	  sampling, we sample new parentages now according their posterior
	  probabilities: q(x_i,x_j) = Pr(x_j)/ (1.0 - Pr(x_i)) 

	* Less stringent filtering of parentages => slightly more accurate
	  posteriors with marker panels with low exclusion probabilities.

Minor Improvements:

	* output genotypes for the RMES program (selfing rate estimations) with
	  --rmesout.

	* manpage 

Bugfixes:

	* Initial trio/pair LODs wrong with missing data (correct during SA/MCMC,
	  thus this bug had little to no consequences)
	* various minor bugfixes for --updatefreqs 

2009-11-07  Markus Riester  <markus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de>

Major Bugfix (Linux and Mac):

	* MCMCMC temperature wrong, T was assumed instead of 1/T. 

Minor Improvements:

	* less memory consumption without age data

Version 1.1
===========

2009-16-06  Markus Riester  <markus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de>

New Features:

	* fullsibtest:
	    
		Tests for "indirect" fullsibs
		-----------------------------
	    If A,B and B,C are FS  with significant p-Value, then FRANz will 
	    test A and C. If A and C are unlikely FS, then A,B or B,C is a false 
	    positive, if they are likely (but not significant) A,B,C are 
	    fullsibs.

		Define tests
		------------
		One can now define the tests with the --fullsibH0 option.

		Output fullsibs
		---------------
		the --siblingsoutformat option allows the output of the fullsibs as
		FRANz,txt and/or CSV file.


	* Nicer Graphviz pedigrees.	  

Many performance enhancements: 
	* no critical OpenMP sections necessary anymore
	* MCMC or SA only when this is necessary (e.g. no age data)
	* many minor optimizations


Version 1.0
===========

2009-22-05  Markus Riester  <markus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de>

First stable release. Thanks for all bugreports and feature requests :)
