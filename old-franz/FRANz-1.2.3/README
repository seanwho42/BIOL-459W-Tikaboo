FRANz 1.2.3
===========

A pedigree (family tree) reconstruction tool for natural populations.

Key Features:
-------------

- Allele frequency analyses:
     * Heterozygosities 
     * Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) 
     * Exact Hardy Weinberg Test
     * Test for Null Alleles

- Exclusion probabilities: Estimate the power of your marker suite. 

- FRANz is flexible, you CAN (but don't have to!) incorporate available prior
  knowledge:

     * Known sub-pedigrees (e.g. mother-offspring arcs) or fullsib groups
     * The sex and years of birth and death of individuals
     * Sampling locations (pairwise distances or coordinates)
     * Sampling rate (number of unsampled males and females)

  Most other tools assume that you know all or most of these.

- User friendly: FRANz uses this prior knowledge to generate the lists of 
  candidate parents internally. Once you have your data in a FRANz input
  file, you are almost done. A GUI for input file generation is available on
  our website.

- Can handle data with typing errors and missing alleles.

- Estimation of the number of unsampled candidate mothers and fathers.

- FRANz is fast: It was written for data sets with thousands of individuals.
  It supports modern CPUs with multiple cores.

- Available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

- Open Source: Obtain FRANz under the GPL Version 3.



Currently NOT supported 
-----------------------

This is not exactly a TODO list, these are some features we might implement if
there is a demand. Please don't hestitate to contact us if you need one of these
features:

 - support for haplo-diploid species
 - support for dominant markers
 - We also don't support what Sheehan and Egeland (doi
   10.1111/j.1469-1809.2006.00345.x) call "soft prior information". One
   example here would be an age dependent probability for sexual reproduction,
   for example with something like

     --femrepro 2:8 --femreproprob 1,2,3,4,3,2,1

   we could say that the reproductive potential of a three year old female is
   twice the one of two year old females.  


Installation
============

Source Package
--------------

For the inpatient, 

  ./configure 
  make check  (optional, may take a while)
  make install

For multicore CPUs (highly recommended! requires GCC >=4.2 or ICC).

  ./configure --enable-openmp
  make check (optional)
  make install

I develop with --enable-openmp, so it is better tested than the single
CPU version. See INSTALL for detailed instructions.

Mac OS X
========

For Leopard, you can either download the installer or you can compile the
source package (this works with older Mac OS X Versions as well).

To compile the source package, you need the Apple Developer Tools. To enable
OpenMP, you have to compile FRANz with gcc-4.2 (or newer) or Intel's ICC. GCC
4.2 is available on Leopard:

  ./configure --enable-openmp CC=gcc-4.2
  make check (optional)
  make install

On Tiger if you don't want to install a recent compiler (e.g. from
finkproject.org):

  ./configure
  make check (optional)
  make install

Windows
=======

If you want to install FRANz on Windows, you can use the installer available
from our website. Currently, only the single CPU version is available for
Windows. Linux and Mac are still the recommended platforms.

To compile the source package, you will need something like Cygwin (this
should give you the multi-core Version) or MinGW (there are experimental
releases with OpenMP support). Make sure that FRANz is compiled with -DWIN32.
Otherwise at least the progressbar will not work.


Additional configure Flags
==========================

  --enable-openmp      OpenMP support
  --enable-debug       Enables debug code and compiles with -g -O0
  --enable-assertions  Enables assertions. Warning: will make the program
                       really slow

Tutorial
========

Once you have your data in the input format, analyzing it should be easy.
There are some Perl scripts in extras/input to convert Excel (saved as
CSV-file) or migrate data. There is also an user friendly CSV to FRANz
converter available on the FRANz website.

Also check the manpage 
  
  man FRANz
