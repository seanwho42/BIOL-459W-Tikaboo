2.0:
- aunt/uncles mismatch distributions
- use fullsib information to include unsampled parents in pedigree output
- SNPs
- allele freqs for each thread and, optionally, for each sampling location
- more MCMC diagnositic tools (at least some plots)
- speedup update functions (allele freqs-will be difficult).
- option to dump sampled pedigrees
- cleanup the TC stuff in pedigree.c/dag.c
- gibbs sampling: * pairs or triples of loci? 
                  * only alleles that are used in LOD calculations
- Is there a better way of filtering than this arbitrary --mintyped parameter?
- maybe switch from MT to dSFMT
- implement my world domination formula
