 *
 * This file provides a simple data structure for p-values. In a first step,
 * the data structure is initialized by defining the range of the distribution
 * and a grid size. For example:
 *
 *   *pv_lup = PVALUEinit(100, -1, 3);
 *
 * This will initialize a lookup table in the range [-1, 3]. This range is
 * devided in a grid of size 100. Values smaller than -1 will return the value
 * stored for -1, values > 3 the one stored for 3. You should make sure that
 * these ends have p-Values of 0.0 and 1.0, respectively. 
 * 
 * In the second step, you add the p-values to the distribution. For example
 *
 *   PVALUEadd(*pv_lup, 2.5, 0.001);
 *
 * This says a value of 2.5 has a p-value of 0.001.
 *
 * In a last step, you can "smooth" the distribution:
 *
 *   PVALUEfill(*pv_lup);
 *
 * This will fill unset grid-points with the values of their nearest 
 * neighbors. 
 *
 * Now you can lookup p-values in O(1), for example:
 *
 *  PVALUEfind(*pv_lup, 2.64);
